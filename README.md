## Introduction
The Object-Aware Scanning Benchmark (OASC), which aims to facilitate quantitative evaluation of object-aware scene scanning and reconstruction, is a collection of Gazebo virtual scenes, based on existing scene dataset [SUNCG](http://suncg.cs.princeton.edu/). We select 66 appropriate human-modeled synthetic scenes which are suitable for robot autoscanning and slightly adjust them to avoid collision. The collection contains 5 scene categories, including bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom and office.

## Evaluation metrics
You can evaluate the performance of object-aware scanning from several aspects:
### Object recognition
For object recognition task, each object class label can be found in `SUNCG/ModelCategoryMapping.csv`. We use SUNCG model id as Gazebo model name, so the correspondence between model name and object category is straightforward.
### Single-view object detection
You can use both original rendering RGBD images from SUNCG or simulated color and depth images from Gazebo, however the latter lacks of ground truth and you may have to annotate by yourself.
### Object-level segmentation
You can measure the Rand Index of the segmentation against its ground-truth. See `tools/RandIndex.cpp` for details.
### Object coverage rate & coverage quality

## Requirements
Our benchmark and tools are mainly tested in Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo (with Gazebo 2.2.3), although other environmnet may still work. If you are a novice to ROS, you can get more information from [here](www.ros.org).

## Usage
Each scene directory include a number of model directories and a `room.world` file. Copy these models into your `.gazebo/models/` and run `gazebo room.world` to carry out a virtual scene in Gazebo. You can refer to `tools/json_2_world.py` on how to transfer a SUNCG `house.json` file into a Gazebo scene, however you may have to add walls by yourself.
